# Meetup robotic simulator

This is a python robotic simulator to be developed (mostly) during
[meetup](https://www.meetup.com/grenoble-coding-workshop) on-site live coding sessions.

We are just getting started and there are many things to do ...

If you are new to software development or to robotics -- don't be afraid. The point is
to:
+ collaborate with other people on a software project
+ see good coding practices
+ use git!
+ learn about robotics and solve cool problems
+ practice your python
+ write technical documentation
+ ...

The preliminary plan is to derive and implement the equations of motion of floating-base
system (e.g., a humanoid robot). In the process many design choices would have to be
made: how to write documentation, what formulation/algorithms to use, how to visualize
our system, code structure, testing, etc. Depending on the people involved, this project
might go in various directions ...
